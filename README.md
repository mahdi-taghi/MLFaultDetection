# Fault Detection Using PCA and Decision Tree Classifier

This repository implements a machine learning pipeline for fault detection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and a Decision Tree Classifier for classification. The project focuses on preprocessing, analyzing, and classifying fault data to ensure high accuracy and efficient computation.

## Features
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA is applied to reduce the complexity of the dataset while retaining the most important features.
- **Fault Classification:** Decision Tree Classifier is used to classify data into fault and non-fault categories.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes metrics such as confusion matrix and classification reports for performance evaluation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
